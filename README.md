This is our Fullstack Academy group project 'Grace Shopper'.

We've built a basic e-commerce website.  The site is built on Node.js using Express, Postgresql, React, React Router, and React Bootstrap as our foundations.  Styling and font appearences achieved using NES-style CSS framework available [here](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/#).  Payment processing uses strip-js available [here.](https://stripe.com/). Third party authorization used with Passport available [here.](http://www.passportjs.org/)

Our site sells Pokemon, allowing guests and registered users to place items into their cart for later purchase.  Registered user carts are maintained and accessible across muiltiple devices.  Guest carts are maintaineed through page closures or page refreshes allowing them to return to shopping where you left off.  Our registered users can view order history and change/update information via their Account page.

Database/product changes are accessible via our admin dashbaord for admin accounts.  Inventory tracking, sales metrics, account management, etc..are maintained there.
